# ‚ö° **Dcryptor** ‚ö°

## Overview

Dcryptor is an android app using OCR tech to recognise text, more precisely, crypted-text and then sends the data to a server to decrypt it recursively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

The app has a easy to use Flat-UI. It recognizes and converts the text in the image(preferably crypted), using one of the best, Google's own Optical Character Recognition libraries, and passes it to highly efficient decrypting algorithms to show the hidden meaning behind the encrypted text.

You can click the picture using the built in camera feature or, can use an existing picture which is already on your phone.

The application does not only show the final decrypted text, it also shows the text after each round of decryption, in case anyone misses something.
